<center><h4>Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone</h4>
	<p>"Turning the envelope over, his hand trembling, Harry saw a purple wax seal bearing a coat of arms; a lion, an eagle, a badger and a snake surrounding a large letter 'H'."<br>
Harry Potter has never even heard of Hogwarts when the letters start dropping on the doormat at number four, Privet Drive. Addressed in green ink on yellowish parchment with a purple seal, they are swiftly confiscated by his grisly aunt and uncle. Then, on Harry's eleventh birthday, a great beetle-eyed giant of a man called Rubeus Hagrid bursts in with some astonishing news: Harry Potter is a wizard, and he has a place at Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry. An incredible adventure is about to begin! </p>

<center><h4>Inception</h4>
	<p>Inception centres on brooding “extractor” Dom Cobb (played by Leonardo DiCaprio)—a thief who invades targets’ dreams through a chemical-induced shared dream state in order to steal valuable information. Having a reputation for being the best in his business, Cobb is commissioned by wealthy businessman Mr. Saito (Ken Watanabe) to take on the exceptional feat of reverse extraction—planting an idea in a target’s mind, otherwise known as inception—in order to eliminate a business competitor. Cobb assembles a crew to attempt the purportedly impossible task: longtime associate Arthur (Joseph Gordon-Levitt), master manipulator Eames (Tom Hardy), chemist Yusuf (Dileep Rao), and “architect” Ariadne (Ellen Page), who is in charge of creating the dreamscapes the team will occupy. In order to plant the idea, Cobb and his crew must descend through several layers of dreaming to penetrate the target’s subconscious. In the process, however, Cobb’s own subconscious starts to surface—to disastrous effect. The team is repeatedly hindered by a subconscious projection of Cobb’s dead wife, Mal (Marion Cotillard), and Cobb himself is forced to question whether his reality is as real as it seems. </p>

    <center><b>The third film is Memento </b></center><br>

<center><h4>Memento</h4>
	<p>Pearce stars as a man who, as a result of a past trauma, has anterograde amnesia (the inability to form new memories) and has short-term memory loss approximately every five minutes. He is searching for the persons who attacked him and killed his wife, using an intricate system of Polaroid photographs and tattoos to track information he cannot remember. Memento is presented as two different sequences of scenes interspersed during the film: a series in black-and-white that is shown chronologically, and a series of color sequences shown in reverse order (simulating for the audience the mental state of the protagonist). The two sequences meet at the end of the film, producing one complete and cohesive narrative. </p>

<center><h4>The Notebook</h4>
	<p>The Notebook is a 2004 romantic drama film directed by Nick Cassavetes and written by Jeremy Leven from Jan Sardi's adaptation of the 1996 novel by Nicholas Sparks. The film stars Ryan Gosling and Rachel McAdams as a young couple who fall in love in the 1940s. Their story is narrated from the present day by an elderly man (portrayed by James Garner) telling the tale to a fellow nursing home resident (played by Gena Rowlands, who is Cassavetes's mother).

The Notebook received generally mixed reviews, but performed well at the box office and received a number of award nominations, winning eight Teen Choice Awards, a Satellite Award, and an MTV Movie Award. The film became a sleeper hit and has gained a cult following. On November 11, 2012, ABC Family premiered an extended version with deleted scenes added back into the original storyline. </p>
